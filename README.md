# MangaLibraryDB
An idea of a manga library that lends and sells mangas and manhwas.<br/>
I manually created the DB based on Platzi's "Curso de SQL y MySQL"<br/>
I copied the clients information to do the querys.<br/>
This is a very small extraction of a database based on myAnimeList: https://myanimelist.net/<br/>
